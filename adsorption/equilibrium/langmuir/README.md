# The Langmuir model (1918)

$$q_{eq}=\frac{q_{L}K_{L}C_{eq}}{1 + K_{L}C_{eq}}$$

where:

- $q_{eq}$ is the adsorbate concentration in the solid phase at equilibrium;
- $C_{eq}$ is the adsorbate concentration in the fluid phase at equilibrium;
- $q_{L}$ is the maximum adsorption capacity of the monolayer;
- $K_{L}$ is the model constant;
